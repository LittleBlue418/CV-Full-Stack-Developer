                        <p>I am experienced in media and design, particularly in the field of video production. I have
                            recently
                            transitioned into software development, having trained with the Code Institute on their
                            full-stack
                            developer course. <br>
                            <br>
                            I have excellent written and verbal communication skills, and value a collaborative culture
                            of
                            transparency and feedback. I enjoy problem solving, working around both technical and
                            creative
                            challenges to find interesting new solutions.

                        <p>Two common threads that have run throughout my career are creativity and
                            technology, they are qualities that I both look for and aim to bring
                            to any role. For me programming was a logical next-step from AV,
                            incorporating my enthusiasm for technology and my passion for creativity.

                        <p>The Code Institute course that i am studying on covers a range of front-end and
                            full-stack skills and tools. So far I have been studying HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
                            During this project i have also been studying a little JavaScript to add some
                            back-end functionality to this site. <br>
                            <br>
                            As well as the Code Institute, I have also been studying with a non-profit
                            organization called Pink Programming. I have recently attended a camp where we
                            were introduced to Visual Studio, and programming in C# for Windows Apps.
